# MotiL #

This repository is the official implementation of **MotiL** for micro- and macromolecules, 
which is proposed in a paper: [**Diffusion-primed molecular contrastive learning for micro- and macromolecules**]. 

**After running the provided scripts, you will get the following logs where the fine-tuned results align with those reported in our paper.**
