# MotiL

> **Mo**lecular mo**ti**f **L**earning for molecular property prediction
>
> 🧬 A motif-centered pretraining framework for molecular property prediction

This repository is the official implementation of **MotiL** for micro- and macromolecules, which is proposed in our [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-66685-w).

MotiL is a molecular pretraining framework centered on **motif learning**.  
This repository contains two parts:

- 🔬 `MotiL_micromolecule`: code for small-molecule pretraining and downstream prediction
- 🧫 `MotiL_macromolecule`: code for macromolecule pretraining and downstream prediction

## ✨ Overview

MotiL learns molecular representations through three main stages:

1. 🌱 **Diffusion priming**
2. 🧠 **Bi-scaled training**
3. 🎯 **Task-specific fine-tuning**

The goal is to learn better molecular representations before downstream property prediction, so that the model can perform well on both micromolecule and macromolecule tasks.

## 🔬 Micromolecule

This part is the official implementation of **MotiL** for micromolecules.

We propose **Molecular motif Learning (MotiL)**, a novel pretraining representation learning method for molecules.

### Brief introduction

MotiL includes three phases:

1. 🌱 **Diffusion priming**
2. 🧠 **Bi-scaled training**
3. 🎯 **Task-specific fine-tuning**

**Diffusion priming**  
The diffusion molecular model in MotiL enables the GNN encoder to accurately capture molecular structure before contrastive learning.

**Bi-scaled training**  
This phase is augmentation-free. MotiL uses network pruning to generate two distinct representations, and also enforces consistency between representations from the same graph, such as a small molecule or protein, or the same motif, such as a functional group or amino acid.

**Task-specific fine-tuning**  
The pretrained GNN encoders are used to predict representations for unseen molecules. These representations are then fed into an MLP classifier to learn the relationship between graph representations and ground-truth molecular property labels.

### Included resources

- 📁 Benchmark datasets are already provided in `MotiL_micromolecule/data/`
- 💾 A pretrained checkpoint is already included in `MotiL_micromolecule/dumped/pre-train/1-model/`

### Install environment

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running MotiL

For pretraining, including diffusion priming and bi-scaled training:

```bash
cd MotiL_micromolecule
bash pretrain_motil.sh
```

The script runs:

```bash
python pretrain.py --exp_name 'pre-train' --exp_id 1 --step pretrain --gpu 5
```

For finetuning:

```bash
cd MotiL_micromolecule
bash finetune_motil.sh
```

The provided fine-tuning script includes example commands for:

| Task | Type |
|------|------|
| BBBP | Classification |
| ClinTox | Classification |
| BACE | Classification |
| ESOL | Regression |

If needed, please change the `--gpu` setting in the script to match your machine.
